## The honesty gate `[HARD]`

Canonical in root `PRODUCT.md § Guardrails — o portão de honestidade`; repeated here because this is the rule that loads
when someone is about to ship a flow. If the two ever disagree, `PRODUCT.md` wins.

These do not bend, and they come before any conversion target:

- **No false urgency.** A counter that resets, "only 2 left" that is not true, "offer ends today"
  that does not end.
- **Consent is not pre-checked.** Opt-in is the user's action.
- **The exit is visible.** Cancel, close and back exist and are findable.
- **The total cost appears before the commitment**, not at the last step.
- **No pattern that depends on the user not noticing** in order to work.

If a conversion technique needs the person not to notice, it does not go in. This is not abstract
ethics: it is what separates a metric that holds from one that collapses when the user works it out.

## Flow

- **First use shows value before asking for data.** Every field before the first benefit costs
  people.
- **The empty state teaches.** It is the new user's first screen and the most neglected one.
- **A long form is split, with visible progress** and goes back without losing what was typed.
- **A destructive action confirms; a reversible one does not.** Confirming everything trains people
  to click without reading.
- **An error says what to do**, not what happened. "Validation failed" helps nobody.

## Cognitive load

- One decision per screen when the decision matters.
- A smart default beats one more option.
- What the person already answered is not asked again.

## Review

Before shipping a flow change, answer: **what does this screen ask for, what does it give back, and
what happens if the person abandons it halfway?** All three need an answer.

## Notas deste projeto

- Funil: `form → WhatsApp` (`lead.leadFlow: "form-then-whatsapp"`). Duas superfícies de captura —
  o modal `LeadFormDialog.astro` e a seção inline `Aplicacao.astro` (`#inscricao`) — fazem
  `POST /api/leads` e passam por `/redirecionando`, que dispara `lead_submit` antes de abrir o
  WhatsApp da SDR.
- Consentimento LGPD é ação do usuário, nunca pré-marcado, e todo campo novo carrega `<label>` real,
  validação e erro acessível.
- Datas, lotes e credenciais são fatos verificáveis — copy não confirmada entra como PROPOSTA.
  Posicionamento e guardrails completos na raiz `PRODUCT.md`.
